Purpose: The purpose of this project is to create an LED sword that can be used 
as part of a costplay outfit. The sword has 6 modes, four elemental modes, one 
neutral mode, and one pink mode. In each sword mode different LED displays and
sound effects are emitted to match with the mode. For example, water mode will 
turn the sword blue with water flowing sound effects whenever the sword is moved.
Lastly the sword has one main modes for how the user interacts with it: 
Chosen mode - The Effects only appear while the handle is gripped

Sensors: Force Sensor, accelerometer, button
Actuators: Servo, LED strip lights, speakers, five colored LEDs indicators 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions:
    - On start up the sword is white to indicate neutral mode, the wings/flower is closed
    - When the force sensor is first touched, a random elemental mode is chosen 
    - In these modes, swingind the sword will trigger a sound effect to be played 
    - if the user sishes to change modes they must press the mmode change button
      - Note: No special task is requored to choose a mode, toggling thorugh modes
             - by pressing the button takes the user to a new mode automatically 
    - Note: For future versions, if the force sensor is released at any time the sword will enter 
            - neutral mode, for this version the force sensor can be released with no consequences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sword Functions Details:
The sword features 4 elemental modes (Earth, Wind, Water, Fire), one neutral mode, and one pink mode. 
In each mode, the sword lights up in the appropriate colors (ie. blue for water) and when swung outputs elemental sound effects 
(ie. water splashing for water). The special twist is that the sword is only active when the handle is gripped. 
This is because anime swords are typically fueled by mana and/or only glow when touched by the right person. 
To create this "chosen one" illusion I placed a small force sensor somewhere on the grip at a location that only I, or whoever the sword is made for, would know. 
The sword elemental modes are only active when this force sensor is pressed, therefore unless the owner knows the location of the sensor the sword won't work. Lastly, just for fun,
I added a set of moving wings at the bottom of the blade that swings open when the force sensor is touched and closes when the force sensor is no longer being touched.

Wiring Details: 
The sword currently uses the following electrical components: 5 LEDs, a push button, a USB-A breakout board, two 100uF capacitors,
a level shifter, a black Beagleboard, led strip lights, a 5V USB-A power adapter, a force sensor, 
an accelerometer, a servo, a USB-A Speaker, one 1kohm resistor, and one 3.3kohm resistor. 
The final project will also include a 5V battery with two USB-A outputs and a power switch to eliminate 
the need for a computer to power the beagle board and the led strip lights. Pin layouts are given in the more details link and in the SWord class definition in the Sword code. 
They are several things worth noting. First, the two capacitors are connected to the USB-A breakout board in order to provide enough initial power to the board.
Second, the accelerometer is used to detect a swing of the sword, if the sword is swung a sound effect corresponding to the chosen elemental mode is randomly 
chosen and played. Third, the servo is used to open the wings/flower while the touch sensor is being touched.
Lastly, the LEDs are used for indicating which elemental mode the sword is currently in
